 <br><br>In-Game Date: Unknown<br>
Dimension: 1<br>Key Events:<br>
<br>Master’s Identity and Dealings: The session begins with <a data-href="The Master" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-master.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Master</a> appearing changed, resembling actor William Smith. He negotiates for his release in exchange for providing detailed information about <a data-href="The Gnome" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-gnome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gnome</a>, fearing for his life.
<br>Character Insights and Plans: <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> and <a data-href="Leandra" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/good-guys/leandra.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Leandra</a> reveal their backgrounds as professional thieves, adding depth to their characters. The team learns about ongoing government efforts to enforce a debit card system, which Leandra is trying to exploit.
<br>Templar’s Reputation and Contacts: <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> discovers he is wrongly blamed for significant damage and a death at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. He meets <a data-href="Marvin" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/good-guys/marvin.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvin</a>, a street sweeper with useful information about local shelters and a hidden depot that might be linked to North Korean activities.
<br>Undercover Operations: The team, disguised humorously due to <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>’s illusions, attempts to extract Councilman Bunch from jail. This involves creating various diversions, including a fire illusion and disguising themselves as various characters from the Village People.
<br>Dramatic Rescue and Exchange: Amidst their rescue operation, they switch <a data-href="Deric Brunch" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/good-guys/deric-brunch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Deric Brunch</a> with <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a> to smuggle him out. They then delve into extracting crucial information about a power plant scheme linked to <a data-href="The Fiddler" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-fiddler.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Fiddler</a>, who is revealed to be scheming across dimensions.
<br>Confrontations and Revelations: The session is filled with tense confrontations, including a standoff with <a data-href="Josh Hawley" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/josh-hawley.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Josh Hawley</a> and <a data-href="Eric Greitens" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/eric-greitens.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Eric Greitens</a> in an office filled with peculiar and valuable items. After a successful extraction of valuable documents and items, they face heavily armed adversaries but manage to escape using another of <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>’s portals.
<br>Escape and Subsequent Plans: The escape is executed with a mix of clever illusions and bold maneuvers, ending with them returning Bunch to the jail to avoid further complications, preserving his status quo.
<br>Dimensional Intrigues: <a data-href="The Fiddler" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-fiddler.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Fiddler</a>’s real intentions are revealed to involve interdimensional correspondence and the abduction of superbeings, adding a significant layer of intrigue and danger to the campaign.
<br>Note: This session blends high-stakes espionage, character development, and supernatural elements with a rich narrative full of humor, action, and strategic planning. The team’s ability to navigate complex scenarios using their unique skills and the introduction of dimensional themes sets the stage for further adventures and conflicts.<br>]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-13-february-3,-2024.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 13 - February 3, 2024.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 23:36:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[KC Heroes]]></title><description><![CDATA[

(Mantis is holding an accordion—he was busking (badly) as a cover for hanging out on the street)<br>
Harry is crouched within view of the transaction and Mantis, changed into his hero outfit.<br>

 <br><br>In-Game Date: April 11, 2022<br>
Dimension: 24<br>Key Events:<br>
<br>Continued Chaos from Previous Session: After <a data-href="Mark Renallo" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/mark-renallo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mark Renallo</a>’s brunch with <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a>, chaos erupts as Mantis resizes under a BMW, causing it to flip over two individuals handling a weapon transaction. The BMW crashes, and gunshots ensue.
<br>Intervention by Trenchcoat: A <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Automatic Man" data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">man in a trenchcoat</a> emerges from a “Handsy Plumber” van and fires an energy beam from his hand, incapacitating a shooter. This person is later engaged with <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> in a confrontation that seems to have no effect on him.
<br>Mantis’s Actions: Mantis uses an accordion to knock down a man holding the suspected weapon case, which contains what appears to be plastic explosives. He later removes this bomb and hides it under a car.
<br>Manifester’s Teleportation and Illusions: <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> teleports using a swirl of black and purple mist to assist and create distractions during the fight, including illusions to immobilize Trenchcoat.
<br>Supernatural Elements: Voices are heard in the heads of the characters, directing the dark blobs and commenting on the situation, indicating an unseen psychic or supernatural controller. <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> sees invisible beams of energy, suggesting the presence of forces hidden from normal sight.
<br>Bloody Retreat and New Attacks: The duffle bag holder is left bleeding severely as the dark blobs retreat into a tunnel. A new character with a submachine gun appears, firing at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Automatic Man" data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Trenchcoat</a> without effect.
<br>Final Confrontations: Mantis pursues the retreating dark blobs into a tunnel, while <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> deal with the aftermath and regroup, contemplating their next moves.
<br>Note: This session deepens the complexity of the conflict with multiple physical and supernatural confrontations, introducing new mysterious characters and unseen forces manipulating events behind the scenes.<br><br>Session 3 (12/18/22)<br>
In game: Monday April 11 continued<br>
Mantis resizes as the BMW drives over him, boosting it up and over the two guys making the transaction. The BMW veers off, quickly crashing<br>
More gunshots<br>
The Handsy Plumber van: a guy in trenchcoat gets out<br>
3 blobby creatures toward Mantis/dufflebag<br>
Trenchcoat fires energy beam from his hand into shooter behind MS who collapses to the ground, appears incapacitated and is clearly a khaki tech [Paul says: I call them Khaki Tacs as in tactics, but I like this.  I will start mixing Matt's term in with my own.]<br>
Templar sneaks between cars towards the transaction<br>
Mantis uses accordion to smash down around the man holding suspected weapon case, slumping him to the ground Looney Tunes style<br>
Manifester teleports – swirling mist around him, cloud of black and purple mist – to man incapacitated by Trenchcoat, drags him behind cover; yells to bystander to call for help<br>
Oozy oscillating darkness – two run at Dufflebag who tries to flee, darkness envelopes him<br>
Trenchcoat sends energy bolt at another khaki tech who collapses<br>
Templar runs towards Trenchcoat, vaults over wall/fence<br>
Mantis grabs case (4 ft long, gun-shaped), runs behind some cars and opens case. Sees what looks like a bunch of plastic explosives with device wired to it; lights and antenna.<br>
Templar runs up on Trenchcoat, wraps an arm around his throat and squeezes. Does not seem to have any effect at all. There’s no give even in the neck.<br>
Mantis removes “bomb” slides under car in front of him, and closes the case.<br>
Trenchcoat jumps forward with Templar still holding on; launches about 90 feet near the agent who he blasted last. On impact, Templar falls off to the side.<br>
Hear screaming from the darkness blobs.<br>
Manifester jumps onto hood; produces illusion for Trenchcoat of dark tendrils coming out of ground to immobilize him<br>
We hear voice in our heads saying “You simple creatures. Don’t eat him. Just get the bag”  [Paul says: Depending on exact locations, Mantis Shrimp heard the voice.  The Templar and Manifester probably did not.  Also, Mantis Shrimp saw a beam of colors or at least a collection of colors surrounding the area where Mantis Shrimp and the van and blobs of darkness where.  The nature of the colors would make it clear to Mantis Shrimp that he is seeing something that is invisible to normal human sight.]<br>
Screaming stops. Two blobs begin moving back towards tunnel. Duffle bag is gone, but holder is bleeding with rib bones exposed.<br>
A guy steps out with submachine gun and starts firing at Trenchcoat. Some shots hit with no apparent effect except to damage his clothes<br>
Templar attempts to shoot machine gun out of new guy’s hands. He staggers but does not collapse.<br>
Mantis steps out with suitcase, threatens to blow it up with his fingers. Sees figure in the mole hole. Weird appearance (ashen skin, unusually large head, purple openings in skin, average height, dark clothing with a large collar). Hear voice in heads “Hurry you creatures. He’s insane!”<br>
[Paul says: Just before hearing that statement, Mantis Shrimp sees a beam of energy traveling to the area basically between the two blobs of darkness.  That beam is coming out of the slightly bulbous head of the ashen-skinned figure.  The beam touches the ground and spreads out in a circle about fifty feet in diameter, which would include where Mantis Shrimp is standing.  Again, the colors are not in the visible light spectrum seen by typical humans.]<br>Templar and Manifester see, with great effort, Trenchcoat pulls at something that isn’t there. He throws something that isn’t there. Then takes a few steps towards New Guy. Templar sees nothing. Manifester gets it.<br>
Manifester teleports to top of Handsy Plumber van with his swirling black/purple mist<br>
Voice in heads “Dramatic. Rather amateurish.”<br>
[Paul says: Mantis Shrimp heard that voice.  Eric, whether or not Manifester heard that statement depends on Manifester's Ego Defense Score and Intelligence Score.  However, because the power is doing no harm to Manifester, other than insulting him, I will allow you to say that Manifester allowed himself to hear the voice, rather than defend against it.  If you choose that option it does not commit you to allowing any future use of the power against you.]<br>
Mantis hurls the case at one of the blobs. It clatters without apparently hitting anyone<br>
Trenchcoat runs towards machinegun; blasts him and guy collapses.<br>
MOLES are nearly back to entrance of tunnel<br>
Templar begins to retreat<br>
Mantis follows the MOLES<br>
Manifester hits Trenchcoat with ?????. It doesn’t knock him down.  [Paul says: Manifester created an illusion of a beam of energy or energy blast hurtling into Trenchcoat.  Matt may have put question marks because Mantis Shrimp cannot see what Manifester is Manifesting, which gets at Manifester because he wants to impress lots of people.]<br>
MOLES get into opening of tunnel with Mantis in pursuit. Weird figure has retreated.<br>
Trenchcoat grabs Machingun guy and jumps again, landing behind the van.<br>
Templar runs<br>
Mantis continues chasing MOLES<br>
Templar circles into parking garage<br>
Mantis enters blob of darkness, closing his eyes as if entering water, swinging fists. Doesn’t connect. Can hear that he is very near someone.<br>
Trenchcoat opens back of van. Puts guy inside van.<br>
Mantis detects scrambling around him, something seems engaged with him<br>
Manifester from on top of van; jumps down a few feet from Trenchcoat. Holds out his hand and does a psychic attack. Trenchcoat wobbles. ]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-3-december-18,-2022.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 3 - December 18, 2022.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 22:29:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 4 - January 15, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[

In game: Monday April 11 continued Trenchcoat jumps in back of van which begins backing away; beeping. Nobody is driving. In the dark, Mantis hits. A darkness blob hits back to front of hole giving Mantis some view. Sees sloping down tunnel with a dark blob in front of him. The eerie voice says “Simple creature don’t engage with him. He’s insane.” Templar makes it to second floor of garage. Peaks down, sees a dark blob pop out of the tunnel; van moving slowly backwards. Templar takes a shot at tires of van… van is obviously very heavily armored. Mantis tries to tackle blob deeper in tunnel but whiffs. Hears something go past him. Others see tall athletic woman, pale skin, long dark hair, wearing fur and carrying high heels emerge from hole. The voice says “Barbara what are you doing? I thought we were learning to trust each other. You said if I allowed you to observe today, you wouldn’t try to leave. I knew I should have scanned your mind.” Manifester teleports between woman and blob with big flourish and strikes a threatening pose facing the blob. Voice “don’t bother with him the amateur, just get Barbara” Manifest shouts “Who are you calling an amateur!?” Templar runs up to fourth floor, sees agents on floor 3 are up and opened trunk of their car on his way. Mantis swings out again and misses. A second something moves past Mantis. Others see another blob come out of the tunnel. A blob tries to run around Manifester. Van makes it out to the street. Manifester kicks out at the darkness but misses. Templar grabs duffle and heads for roof. Mantis runs to the front of the tunnel Van is in street. A gray audi honks at van. Trenchcoat gets out of van, grabs khaki tac. Barbara continues running away, yelling “I’m getting away from you lunatic!”<br>Templar still running. Mantis runs out of the hole, talks to Manifester who says “they’re chasing that woman. you slow them down and I’ll help her” Mantis tries slide tackle at a blob… slides into the darkness and out the other side. Manifester teleports toward Barbara. Moles move try to coral Barbara; darkness of one engulfs Trenchcoat. AUTOMATIC MAN (BRETT WAS TRENCHCOAT ALL ALONG) feels some kind of system anomaly somewhat like pain. He sees a device attached to his upper left arm, feels a Bluetooth-like signal has been coming from it. Can tell internal security system ability has been disabled for six days. He realizes its only because its he’s engulfed in darkness that is blocking all electromagnetic waves that the Bluetooth device is stopped. He disables device properly. He knows he has been deactivated 14 days ago (for 8 days). Realizes he was “stolen” or “kidnapped” from his lab. Has partial memory of what’s going on. Someone has been sending him on missions for six days. He has two holographic memory spheres that he cannot access. Always had one that was sealed but surprised because now there are two. Realizes van is filled with explosives and has proximity trigger that will explode if gets too far from a case.  <br>Templar gets to a door to the roof. Kicks it. Smashes through the deadbolt and it flies open. Mantis goes spinning windmill style into the nearest dark blob, swinging arms and tail, manages to backhand a mole moving it about ten feet, crashing into a vehicle. Audi guy continues to beep. Templar looks out, sees no obvious targets.<br>Mantis tries chucking a VW Bug at the other MOLE, but overshoots, flies over Manifester and car smashes into parked cars. Automatic Man attempts to disable the proximity detector inside the van but cannot locate it. He begins walking, still having khaki tac slung over his shoulder. Guy in Audi screams, tries to back up, hits a parked truck and leaves his car. AM puts down khaki tac on sidewalk. Bends his shotgun into a bowtie. Manifester takes Barbara by the arm, says “Trust me, but this will be disconcerting” and teleports as far down street as he can then asks “who was that voice?” B: that is The Master. He is a terrible person and a telepath. He’s been holding me in the Underworld Manif: I am going to get you to safety, Barbara. Not to be overly familiar but I heard your voice in my head. Templar sees someone in dark clothing with bulbous head float out of the hole and hover into the air, looking around. Mantis observes the glowing light and notes AM on the sidewalk. AM can tell device that was controlling him has signal coming from municipal airport. AM asks Mantis what is going on, who are they fighting. Mantis says him and also the MOLES. AM says I was being controlled but now I’m trying to stop a big explosion. Mantis says That makes sense, him too! Best thing to do is distract the MOLES. Blobs start scampering towards hovering Master.<br>Manifester targets Master with an illusion an irate man in Audi rushing towards him, blowing horn. Master flies higher into the air to flee the illusionary car. Templar can see person with fiery chem trail flying towards the battle. No clue who it is. Templar takes video on his phone. Mantis tells AM he’s going to stop the explosion, shrinks down, and moving under cars goes to where he hid the satchel contents. Grabs them and starts heading away under cover of cars… unwittingly moving away from the van. Chem Trailer Park Boy flies into area. Says “I am Fire Cube, you shall feel my fury.” He pumps his arm and builds a fiery cube in his hand that grows in size with each pump. AM blasts Fire Cube hard. He doesn’t hit ground but is blasted way back. Templar shoots at AM. A blinding white laser beam blasts a hole in the sidewalk beside AM. Fire Cube starts flying towards Templar saying “You’ll feel the heat of my fury!” Mantis continues running shrunken with the bomb under cars, unfortunately away from the van with proximity monitor. Manif: do you know who the cube guy is? B: I don’t know him. He’s not with the Master. Manif: Stay here. He teleports towards the action but a safe distance from Automatic Man.]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-4-january-15,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 4 - January 15, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 22:29:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 5 - January 27, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Note: This session is filled with high stakes and rapid developments. The interplay between supernatural abilities, personal backstories, and explosive action creates a complex and thrilling narrative. The session ends with the group seeking refuge and regrouping, setting the stage for further revelations and conflicts.<br><br>In game: Monday April 11 continued AM blasts the Master with energy out the palm of his hand, knocked back ~15 feet looking stunned then angry. Shaken by the blow. Khaki Tac shoots at Master and does no damage. Barbara yells out “run while you can! You don’t know what he can do!” Second KT shoots rocket propelled grenade towards AM, moves slowly will take a turn to move. Audi guy: can hear him calling 911. Hear “this is 911. Please hold” MOLES run towards tunnel entrance Beam of energy shoots from Master’s head at Fire Cube; FC stops and starts yelling “you murderer. You sick fucking murderer!” turns and starts going towards AM. (The beam remains visible linking the two) Handy Plumber van starts driving north on Wyandotte Templar shoots Fire Cube, driving him forward. Mantis continues escaping under cars. Fire Cube flies until about 20 m from AM and starts pumping his arm to build a fireball then throws it at AM “You’re going to pay you scum!” Impacts at AM’s feet and explodes, rocks cars, shatters glass, car alarms going off. AM propelled back into street prone. Master looks on gloating. (Fireball burned off most his clothes except his trench coat and shoes) Rocket propelled grenade lands right where AM was standing, massive explosion rocking cars again. Audi guy abandons his car and runs off Handy Plumber van continues driving Templar shoots at Fire Cube but misses Mantis continues running<br>AM shoots his final energy blast into Fire Cube who falls to the ground, landing flat on his back “Shit,” says the Master Barbara is impressed. Handy Plumber continues driving MOLES have gone into the tunnel and their darkness power has faded. They are hunched, human-looking but mouths jutted forward like snouts. They see me and say “why do you care if we steal money meant for an arms dealer?” Manifester jumps on top of the most expensive car near him—a pristine brand new Corolla—and yells “Master, if that is your real name, eat this!” and does ego attack. It rocks him, spiraling until he collapses into the parking lot. Barbara yells “holy fuck!” Khaki Tacs – rifle fires at AM missing. Second one is reloading Handy Plumber van travels 12 more meters, then 12 more Device Mantis is holding starts beeping Templar gathers his gear then rappels down the side of the parking garage again, reaches the ground Mantis resizes from under a car, shrugging it off and sprints towards the middle of the parking lot, shouts to AM “I have the thing!” He shows the device. “The beeping is new!” AM jumps towards Mantis, gets about halfway there. As he jumps, trench coat flaps open and Barbara admires his hardware. Handy Plumber van continues driving. The explosives detonate Just prior to the explosion Manifester from atop the Corolla shouts “Citizens, there is no need to worry. You are all safe now” It is the biggest explosion we’ve seen yet. Mantis flies 30 feet and lands on hood of a car, shrimp shell armor cracking off Shockwave enough to lightly damage Templar Moles run out of tunnel towards Master, back in their darkness form Manifester teleports just outside the action Blobs of dark envelop the Master Khaki Tac shoots AM w high powered rifle, doing nothing KT2 fires grenade but completely misses, explodes in the street Templar sprinting towards the case, taking the medium ground<br>Mantis shrugs off his shell and yells at the MOLES “I don’t care about the arms dealers as much as YOU ATE A FUCKING GUY.” Then he sprints towards the blobs, enters the darkness and immediately shrinks down AM heads towards the blobs, enters the black and punches. He connects and hears a squeal. Blobs move back towards tunnel entrance; Master is no longer lying on the ground Shrunken Mantis jumps towards the middle of the blob and lands on something. Not sure who, but on top of someone in shrunken form Manifester runs back towards Barbara “What are you doing? Run away! There’s still violence here!” Barbara “I want them to get that piece of shit!” “Who is the Master?” “It’s a long story. He’s a sick fuck.” Manifester takes cover behind a car. AM grabs at a MOLE, snags them. Restrains him without harming through a bear hug. MOLE goes limp in AM’s arm, unconscious Mantis feels self moving, MOLE runs into tunnel carrying me. Unclear if carrying Master (to me) Templar one blob of darkness collapses and then see ~5’6” humanish somewhat primate-ish creatures held in AM’s arms. Other blob is moving towards tunnel. Templar continues heading to case, arrives at it, finds it empty. He picks up case Mantis grabs tightly and enlarges and pull. Blob squeals and runs into the tunnel leaving me with the Master. Hear from outside tunnel a woman yell “Fuck him!” Khaki tacs start packing up their stuff to flee<br>Mantis and Templar discuss the case, explains that the contents exploded. Barbara insists that we kill the Master; explains she’s Barbara Wells, was a UMKC accounting student who took time off in winter 2020 who admits she worked as dancer at Bazookas, then started doing commercials. Was at Level 1 Game Shop to do a commercial, never made it to the store before kidnapped by the MOLES. Roommate Jennifer was eaten by MOLES. She asks what day it is—she’s been underground 6 months. Master asking her to marry him; has strange sense of honor and vowed to not use telepathy on her. She says we gotta move before MOLES come to get him; they can just borrow right up underneath us. AM suggests they move on to the Bossanova Hotel where he has a room. He knows he’s supposed to go to front desk of Bossanova if he’s ever lost and in distress. We carry the unconscious MOLE and Master to Bossanova. Manifester and AM walks in to main entrance/lobby. Notes front desk. Two guys looking like Men in Black pretending not to look at them. Front desk guy welcomes AM, “Mr. VonNewman, it’s so nice to have you at the Bossa Nova hotel” Manifester “would one of you gentleman notify the fire department? Their services may be needed across the street”<br>Front desk gives AM a room key for the penthouse, dial 1010 from any phone if you need anything. Also here is a package for you. Points us to the elevator. Manifester requests a room service menu Get to 7th floor. Ahead is a hallway, a worker if vacuuming up broken glass. We all go to AM’s room where none of the windows are damaged oddly. Barbara continues with her story now she feels safe. She explains Master is registered with government, he does jobs for them. He can put memories in people’s heads that don’t exist. While I was there, the military brought a woman to him; Master met with her then they took her away. Then a week(?) later brought me to see news, same woman accused a city councilman of rape (Eric Bunch). Master likes watching news about surface dwellers to know about world above. He likes Mantis Shrimp bc he likes ppl who look different; says surface dwellers will eventually reject him………………… Paul probably has better notes Master wanted to get even with the Gnome Tunnels everywhere under city. MOLES abduct people and eat them. Kevin McMannis councilman trapped underground Entrance down by the river that Barbara knows Master recurring dream of someone in forest searching for him and getting closer and closer [paul has it typed up] Manifester ordering room service until hears the story about the dream then asks Barbara for more details Envelope has: driver’s license for Ian VonNewman, set of keys, valet parking kit, small spiral notebook with notes in numbers, satellite phone, copy of KC Star Wednesday last week, address near Mimi’s Pantry in Riverside There is a knock at the door]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-5-january-27,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 5 - January 27, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 22:44:41 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 6 - February 26. 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[

They also plan to remove a false memory implanted in a reporter at a concert as a demonstration of good faith.
<br>Note: This session intertwines complex character interactions with strategic maneuvers, revealing deeper layers of the narrative involving political manipulation, supernatural abilities, and secretive organizations. The characters’ actions reflect a blend of confrontation, negotiation, and investigative tactics as they navigate the challenges posed by their adversaries and the mysterious circumstances surrounding them.<br><br>Mantis searches mole creature, thick, loose-ish fur and skin, no device for black. Manifester: Barbara do you know what the Master is planning? Barbara: He is trying to survive. He believes that homo sapiens will eventually kill the anomalies. He preaches an agenda of biding time by being useful and accumulating wealth until can hide. Knock on door: Templar can see through door and sees Telly Sevalis looking guy in suit. Mantis carries Mole and Master into bathroom “Who’s there” “It’s me! Your boy Maxy! Let me in! I’ve got us a gig! Let me in!” Automatic Man’s instrument: Keytar Lets him in. “Baby it’s good to see you, I’ve been looking for you.” Looks around and sees everyone “Are you making porn again. No judgment of your hobbies but you need to get more ladies.” Has gig tonight at The Majestic, set up at 8, play at 9 – “I’ll be there” Maxwell Manning and the First Laws is Automatic Man’s band. Play jazz rock fusion Herbie Hancock style. Mantis leaves to take Mole to authorities, sees Mark Renallo arguing with front desk clerk who wouldn’t tell him where we went. Mark gives Mantis ride to police central office. Mark doesn’t think explosion was the weapon the Gnome. Weapon was supposed to be reusable. More than a bomb. Weapon was something bomb. Mark asks if saw a robot. Thinks the weapon is robot. Mantis drops the mole off at the police station, leaving before they can ask any questions but tells them that thinks it is an unregistered anomaly and was at the bomb that exploded. Mantis makes it back to hotel before Master wakes up Back at the hotel room, Templar points gun at Master as he wakes up. Barbara says to just kill him. Manifest: What’s your plan? What are you doing with the city council. Master: Not much. Implanted false memories in reporter (Vicky) to discredit one council member and kidnapped another council member. Not hiding that. I’ve been paid.<br>Soldiers who brought reporter work for Epsilon Force. Their leader is the Brigadier.<br>• The Gnome is into crypo.<br>• Where is my friend? Why did you stop me from ripping off the Gnome?<br>• Barbara and I have rocky relationship Automatic reveals he’s a robot<br>Gnome hired me to figure out if my powers can influence AI. Gnomes reason was to help build a defense against this kind of influence. • Gnome stole Automatic Man • The Gnome had Cyril Sedgwick lives in Briarcliff. Gnome stole (Mantis says “kidnapped”) Automatic Man from the Fiddler. They were both leaders in CRICKET (Civilization Recover Interim Core Knowledge Enclosure Team).<br>AM says he’s hunted from CRICKET<br>• Fire guy was a backup plan to control for Master<br>• CRICKET is underground organization dedicated to preserving human knowledge and civilization to address potential cataclysms.<br>• Rumor of Gnome and Fiddler having falling out over methods is wrong. They had love triangle with Bandwidth.<br>• Need a plan for when humans decide to kill anomalies.<br>Barbara – his weakness is he can only control one mind at a time. Watch him at all times. Templar pulls a set of keys off Master Master lies about having no way to contact Moles, but Barbara reveals they have cell service through Cricket Wireless. Take phone to Master for him to call Moles. Templar gets the phone number begins call with a chess move description. Then says mission failed in part and have been captured as has Fluffy. Fluffy with authorities. They demand release of Councilman McManus, I have no qualms with this. Will cause problems for Epsilon but not for me. I just want to get back to the underground. Agree to release at 9th and Wyandotte. Plan next to get reporter to the Maxwell Manning concert tonight so Master can remove her false memory as another show of good faith.

<br>Note: This session focuses on the trio’s covert operations at a crime scene, showcasing their abilities to navigate and manipulate social interactions and police presence to gather crucial evidence without drawing attention to their real intentions. The investigation into the anomaly hints at deeper supernatural or mysterious forces at play in the city.<br><br>Special Interlude Number 1 (3/4/23)<br>Still Monday, April 11 Templar, Manifester, and Mantis head to St. Mary’s Episcopal Church to investigate an anomaly battle; an alarming “beast” who seems unkillable. The Order sent Templar. As we leave in the 1995 beat up Celica, Hysteria constantly plays on a loop. Lovely Leandra calls Manifester asking why he’s not at Johns Big Deck. He says he’s on his way. Realize they’re being followed by a van, looks like a government type. Manifester tries to lose them. They stop pursuing after a while. Manifester drives to the church. They can’t find parking, so just park illegally. Manifester puts an old ticket on the window and skillfully marks his tire with chalk. “It’s all about illusion, gentlemen.” Outside church is some police tape. Chain link fence around a reflection area is cut. There are police milling about. There is a lab-type vehicle; white unmarked car with cop plates. Mantis walks up to the scene, greets police officers there. One asks for a selfie. As Mantis distracts police, Templar goes to the car undetected. See brown bag in back seat with evidence tape on it. Door of car is locked. Templar attempts to jimmy the lock but failed.<br>
An officer starts to look over Mantis towards the car, but Mantis notices and distracts him. Mantis sees blood in many locations. Talking to the police he scoops up blood onto his finger. He asks for evidence bagging equipment they say it’s in the car. On other side of street, Manifester is texting Leandra about car problems.<br>Mantis heads toward the car saying “oh hey! It’s my buddy Templar.” The cops say they don’t have key to the evidence car, the lab tech does and she’s in the church. But Templar pulls out a swab and takes the sample from Mantis’ finger. There are 4 police with Mantis. Manifester picks on cop and makes illusion of a dog in great distress inside a car down the street. Officer is completely convinced. He heads over to the truck. Tom (wife Becky) – cop Mantis knows. Introduces them to Genevieve and Ezekiel They leave. Manifester drops off Templar at the Catholic Church and takes Mantis home before circling around to meet Leandra at John’s Big Deck.]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-6.5-march-4,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 6.5 - March 4, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 22:59:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 7 - April 14, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Inside the Geodesic Dome: Inside the dome, they encounter a greenhouse environment managed by robotic systems, which turns out to be much more than it seems. As they engage with the facility’s AI and navigate through a complex of advanced robotics and hidden chambers, they delve deeper into the secrets of the place.
<br>Encounter with Dr. Goodfellow: They meet <a data-href="Dr. Goodfellow" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/good-guys/dr.-goodfellow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Goodfellow</a>, a significant figure who explains the historical conflicts between <a data-href="The Gnome" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-gnome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gnome</a> and the Fiddler and expresses his current focus on predicting future events using the Inverted Mayan Long Calendar.

<br>Emerging Threats and Preparations: The session ends with the team gaining new insights into the potential threats and the role they play in the broader narrative of technological and supernatural challenges.
<br>Note: This session explores deeper layers of the ongoing narrative, with significant discoveries about the past interactions and future intentions of key characters. The interactions with advanced technology and AI highlight the blend of science fiction elements with the campaign’s superhero themes. The revelations about <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a>’s role and origin add depth to his character and the overarching plot.<br><br>Session 7 (4/14/23)<br>Everyone meets up at the hotel again. Manifester tells Leandra an elaborate lie about the Celica being towed as abandoned while he was at a Quick Trip getting a taquita and having to go get it from the impound lot so he can’t meet her at John’s Big Deck. The gang decides to head up to Briarcliff area to investigate the geodesic dome and the Gnome. They pull up outside where the Gnome is expected to be. Templar and Mantis are able to see the Gnome’s apartment. There are suspicious shipping containers outside. Templar sees just boxes and packed away items inside, nothing obviously suspicious. Only odd thing is that there’s a power source inside and seems to be refrigerated items. Writing on outside is Korean, says “Wuhon Institute of Virology” Automatic Man monitors cell phones but hears nothing obvious. Templar looks for security systems. Sees only a lock. Mantis rips open one of the doors. Inside are nicely organized cases and materials including a small refrigerator. Mantis opens the fridge. Small cases with vials of greenish fluid inside. Mantis sniffs one. Smells like very acidic lime. Mantis pockets one vial. No documents in the container. Automatic Man hears cell phone call to the police. He is able to get the phone number calling 911. Mantis opens a box and finds unusual looking weapons inside. They appear to be energy weapons. Mantis keeps a tiny one, and gives one big and one small one to Templar. Mantis calls 911 too. Tells them that they should send someone down to check out weird shipping container. They say they have officers on the way. Others disperse to watch. Mantis leaves on his cell phone so they can hear him; sits on top of the shipping container at the open door swinging his legs. Two squad cars come screaming into the parking lot, pull up to Mantis. Officers step out, guns drawn. One yells “Mantis Shrimp!”<br>They pat Mantis down. They inspect the container, asking Mantis about how it got opened. Officer says “we have to check this out. We know where to meet you.” Officer Michaels. Mantis comes clean about ripping open the door. Officer Michael says we’ll need to arrest Mantis. He gets placed in handcuffs and placed in police car. The others call an Uber and get out of there. Mantis slips out of a handcuff and calls his lawyer, famed anomaly defense attorney Paul Hood. He asks if he can “bail out,” so Mantis tells Officer Michael, “on advise of my lawyer, I must bail,” rips open the door, jumps out of the squad car. Walking away as the squad car screeches and turns around he calls Automatic Man. “I bailed out! I’ll meet you at the Mimi’s Pantry?” and he starts walking. The Uber riders arrive first. Mantis walks and arrives a bit later. AM’s satellite phone rings. “Did you get the paper? Did you get the Star?” “Yeah!” “The Spring Training will be illuminating [??], don’t you think?” they hand up. He doesn’t know who they were. Templar has the heebie-jeebies bc there are lots of open lines of sight everywhere, seems unsafe. Lots of unobstructed views down to the geodesic dome. Templar takes scope and investigates the surroundings. Spots Asian man in men-in-black car with Abe Pagoda-looking guy. Templar tells everyone the men-in-black guys are staking out the surroundings from near the garage. Manifester admits can only affect one target at a time. But he targets Abe Pagoda-looking guy to think he stepped in an ant hill and entire body is being swarmed by ants, intending to also distract his partner. Illusion is so powerful, he is even injured some by the ants. We hear an older man screaming (Abe) and Asian guy is very distracted. The squad runs to the dome.<br>Templar notes his x-ray vision will not penetrate the dome as they approach. Manifester feels material looks like stuff people say was recovered from Roswell; seems alien-like. Security camera above the door, but door opens as Automatic Man approaches. On the inside it looks like a greenhouse. We step inside. Rows and rows of fruit bearing plants on raised beds, we cannot recognize them. Box-shaped robot is tending to the plants and ignores us. Door closes behind us and closes behind us with a sealing noise. Templar notices there is no cell phone service. Security camera focuses on AM. “Friend of yours?” Manifester asks. Speakerbox below the camera says “did you see the second Royals game last Tuesday” (same voice as called him earlier). “that game was a lot of fun” Automatic Man checks the box score. He doesn’t remember there being a second game that night but the paper does note a second game with score 10-10. When we say the score, the room begins to slowly spin. A drain in the floor opens to reveal a spiral staircase. We head down the stairs. Leads down 20ft to a lighted chamber. Drain door closes as we go down. Chamber is 12’x12’ square. Each wall has downward facing spigot-like things on wall. There is a bulky robot on wheels on a track. When we arrive, it says “Four visitors.” A bulkhead door moves out and slides left. There is a similar robot in neck chamber: “Please step in and do not block the door.” It asks for our names. It gives its name as “twelve.” 12 knows Mr. Von Neuman.<br>Second bulkhead door opens. Beyond that one is long hallway ~80ft long, 20ft wide. Shelves on walls, tables and stands in middle, various robots moving about. TV on wall shows Buck Rogers episodes. Another TV shows India vs West Indes cricket game seemingly from the 1980s. Floor is on two levels, walkway with center floor below. Very advanced robot or replicant approaches us smiling, greets Automatic Man and introduces himself as Dr. Goodfellow. Automatic Man does not remember him but Dr. G is very happy to have him here. “You know, when the Gnome and the Fiddler had their battle, I pulled a trick on them so their sensors thought this facility was destroyed.” Manifester: “technically that was an illusion. A trick is what a whore does for money.” Dr. G Confides reason for disagreement was deleted from his memory but thinks it was about method. Gnome wanted action; Fiddler wanted observation. Now he can work on the Inverted Mayan Long Calendar his passion project rather than setting the predictions of Nostradamus to quatrains. “would you like to hear a bit of the future?” YES! Has one of us pick a number, adjective, adjective/adverb, and one picks a noun. Dr G explains more about the Mayan Long Calendar. “In the next 3-5 days a very significant event involving 317.576 trustworthy, stationary trout.” Automatic Man gets impression this is the equivalent of a land-based submarine. Templar tells Dr. G about the men in black watching them. Robots make noises as West Indies scores in the cricket match. Automatic Man – I’ve been here before correct? Yes<br>Mantis – what are you doing? Research! The bots have gotten quirky. They have become fascinated in cricket and Buck Rogers. Automatic Man – where do you know me from? From my involvement with the gnome, fiddler and cricket. You are part of the reason I’m trying to predict the future to determine when and how threatening the rise of AI will be. You’re the envoy. The intermediary between homo sapiens and eventual AI technology. Automatic Man – who built me? The fiddler. Mantis – What is Fiddler like? Human 6’1.25” weights 184 lbs. white male. Little interest in sports. Committed to long term survival of human species and civilization. I was developed to help determine the most significant threats to civilization. I can exercise independent judgment which led me to conclude the conflict between gnome and fiddler would doom our efforts. Fiddler would not see Mantis as human.]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-7-april-14,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 7 - April 14, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 23:19:45 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 8 - November 12, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>In-Game Date: Unknown<br>
Dimension: 1<br>Key Events:<br>
<br>Mysterious Discoveries and Changes: As the team leaves the geodesic dome, they notice several anomalies, including a different song in the car, unexpected items like a locked metal suitcase keyed to <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a>’s thumbprint, and changes in the cityscape including a new light rail system and advertisements for a President Harris. These changes hint at a possible shift in reality or timeline.
<br>Stolen Blimp Incident: They discover a trout-designed blimp advertising Freddy the Fisherman’s Trout House has been stolen and vandalized to display a bomb threat. <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> agrees to retrieve the blimp, now causing traffic disruptions on the Buck O’Neil bridge.
<br>Bridge Chaos and Confrontations: At the bridge, an unusual scene unfolds with people dancing to REO Speedwagon’s “Time for Me to Fly,” manipulated by a menacing, gooey entity wearing a tuxedo t-shirt, and another entity referred to as <a data-href="Mosh Pit" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/mosh-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mosh Pit</a>. This entity manipulates the crowd, turning the scene into a dangerous dance party.
<br>Heroic Actions and Battles: Mantis uses a backpack device that grants him flight to engage with the threats. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> work to disrupt the influence of the music controlling the crowd, with <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> successfully breaking the trance using an illusion. A confrontation ensues with <a data-href="Mosh Pit" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/mosh-pit.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mosh Pit</a>, who is knocked out by <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>, and the gooey entity, dubbed <a data-href="Meat Shield" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/meat-shield.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Meat Shield</a> by police, who escapes.
<br>Continued Threats and Resolution: Amidst the chaos, <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> acts to neutralize a potential explosion by managing the hydrogen in the blimp while <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a> deal with incoming attacks from another adversary, <a data-href="Fire Cube" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/fire-cube.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire Cube</a>/<a data-href="Molotov" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/molotov.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Molotov</a>.

<br>Note: This session is filled with action, unexpected twists, and the introduction of new adversaries, continuing to build on the campaign’s theme of superhero confrontations in a dynamically changing environment. The session showcases the team’s ability to adapt to and address both physical and supernatural threats in a setting that increasingly appears to be altered or manipulated by external forces.<br><br>We exit the geodesic dome; overhear Goodfellow saying “eureka!” as we leave. Insider the car: a locked metal suitcase with Mantis sized thumb print: • Cash $250, ID for Claude, tiny gun, hazmat suit, backpack-type device, karate gui w black belt When Manifester starts car, it plays “All I Need is a Miracle” instead of “Hysteria,” freaking out Manifester. Has better fast-food wrappers in car than should be there. Traveling see Mantis Shrimp among celebrity cutouts on roadside. Barry’s trailer is also different. There’s a new light rail system in KC. Automatic Man picks up on radio references to President Harris instead of Biden. In distance see medium-sized fish-designed blimp, trout-like – advertising Freddy the Fisherman’s Trout House. Phone 816-317-576*. Call the number and learn the blimp has been stolen! Mantis agrees to retrieve it. Manifester follows towards the Buck O’Neil bridge. It shoves its way into the bridge entrance, stopping traffic. Giant happy trout. Someone blacked out some of its teeth and wrote “I am a bomb” on it. It is on far side of bridge from us. Templar senses someone is on top of the bridge. In distance hear REO Speedwagon “Time for Me to Fly.” People hearing the music get out of their cars and dance. Music has menacing feel. Something begins lowering itself down from the top of the bridge like silly putty wearing clothes: tuxedo t-shirt. Is larger than normal person and has moving blobs within it. Has crazy eyes and greets Templar “so nice of you to join the dance party.” A blob pushes through skin and it’s a person who screams. Mantis puts on backpack. It gives him wings/power of flight. A couple turns into combat, someone runs past at hyperspeed, jumps up, car goes fuzzy focus; they grab someone out of the car and the car phases through the bridge.<br>Manifester tries to use blink to create portals to transport dancers away from harm—fails. They fizzle out. Templar shoots boom box… the music did not stop. Manifester notes one of the revelers chuckles at the attempt to silence the music. Manifester creates illusion of no music, breaking the trance of the dancers. Manifester points out the baddie among the revelers. Gooey guy says “You found my colleague: Mosh Pit!” then swats at Automatic Man. In distance, see someone flying towards us, looks like Fire Cube. Mosh Pit pulls gun on Manifester but misses. Manifester blasts Mosh Pit with an energy wave, knocking him out. Templar shoots gun out of Mosh Pit’s hand, bullet ricochets to hit Fire Cube/Molotov. Gooey slingshots himself away. Mantis sucks the hydrogen out of the blimp as fireballs go at it, Templar blasting them out of the sky. Molotov runs away. Automatic Man hears police chatter: “Meat Shield” is gooey guy.]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-8-november-12,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 8 - November 12, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 01:15:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 9 - November 19, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Rescue and Recovery: After intense confrontations, the team successfully rescues three people locked in gurneys inside one of the trucks. <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>’s illusions play a crucial role in reviving the comatose victims, leading to their safe extraction.
<br>Blurry’s Revelations and Alternate Reality: The mission concludes at a safehouse, where <a data-href="Blurry" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/blurry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Blurry</a> reveals details about an alternate reality version of Kansas City, characterized by heavy surveillance, the illegality of cash, and FEMA’s significant involvement. This setting raises questions about the dimension or reality the team is currently navigating.
<br>Discovery of Dimensional Differences: <a data-href="Jerry" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/good-guys/jerry.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Jerry</a> recognizes that <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> is not from their dimension, hinting at broader dimensional or reality shifts affecting the team. This discovery aligns with the unusual changes noticed earlier, such as the different president and other anomalies.
<br>Note: This session blends high-octane action with deeper narrative developments, exploring themes of alternate realities and the consequences of supernatural conflicts. The team’s dynamics are tested as they navigate complex challenges in a possibly alternate Kansas City, facing both physical threats and the ethical dilemmas of intervening in dire situations.<br><br>Other hero has fought Meat Shield, Mosh Pit, Molotov three times. He once fought them with Templar in a church. This is second time he’s killed Mosh Pit. When he killed MP before, some people who were under his trance went into comas and are still in them. Cell phones go off—“blurry 51-50 H H” “Wow, those people are being moved. Templar, Jerry got your car fixed. Lets get it.” New guy’s name is Blurry. They drop off blimp outside Freddie’s Trout House then head to garage with Blurry’s directions. See car with cover over it. Garage setup. Blurry is excited to show Templar the car. Pulls cover off to reveal super car: stealth’ed out Humvee with retractable turret, James Bond-style goodies. Starts up and computer console screen brings up “Jerry.” Jerry thinks bad idea to try to help the comatose people who are being moved; Blurry and he argue about whether to save them or just monitor the movement. Blurry thinks Manifester can get them out of the coma. Blurry explains comms will fall off as soon as he phases to use his powers. Jerry confirms 3 tactical looking troop-carrier vehicles carrying people; expect 2 are decoys. We leave in Templar’s Humvee. Blurry warns of someone setting up with weapon on an overpass. Templar misses with guns, but Manifester makes illusion that car is slightly off to the side from where it actually is. They shoot at it and Manifester makes it look like they were blown up. Templar catches up to the three trucks, pulls ahead of them. Mantis jumps onto roof of first one. The trucks spread out. Khahki Tacs lean out windows and aim guns at Mantis<br>Manifester mind blasts one of the shooters: Ripple like a heat wave shoots through the air, shooter collapses dropping gun, skitters down the highway Vehicles bear down on Templar Templar has targeting system aim at drivers and PA system says to “Stop!” Vehicles slam on brakes. Mantis can’t hold on and flies off, tumbling along the ground unceremoniously. Templar brakes and turns car dramatically, then steps out guns drawn. People from the vehicle begin producing weaponry, poking out windows/hatches and some exiting and taking cover behind them. Manifester jumps out of the supercar with swirling mists and grand gesture. Attempts mass illusion for KTs of fireballs raining from sky to make them take cover; fails. With another swirling mist and cloud of smoke, he scurries behind the car. Blurry over comms says “I’m about to go out of focus. I’m starting with the middle one.” KTs begin firing Mantis and vehicle; not even close to hitting. Hit vehicle and no damage done. Templar advances on one of the side vehicles, shoot point blank into engine block and… does nothing. Mantis uppercuts the engine block and demolishes it. Second vehicle goes blurry and all KTs fall out onto the highway. We hear Blurry yell “It’s not number 2” Third vehicle squeals it tires, trying to take off. Templar blasts out it’s tire, slowing it down. They’re still driving on the rims.<br>Mantis jumps towards fleeing vehicle, but falls just short, falling just in front of the back tire, which rolls over him. KTs open fire on Templar, who rolls underneath the truck for cover then shoots with ricochet to hits the other front tire and two KTs. Mantis attempts to pick up the vehicle; grabs the bumper and it rips right off. Manifester makes illusion that vehicle is on fire. They flee. Templar checks out the back of truck. There are three people locked in gurneys inside with medical monitors, unconscious. Manifester uses mass illusion on the comatose people of quiet. They almost immediately start to stir and open their eyes, completely disoriented and confused. We pack them into Templar’s vehicle and drive off. Jerry is annoyed and surprised that the mission worked. Seems to be family of Blurry. Blurry has a safehouse in autobody place near 19th and Vine. 1580 E 19th Street. Jerry quickly realizes Templar is not their Templar; sees Templar is not from this dimension. Meet ragtag group running a resistance to the government. In this reality, KC basically partitioned off. Cash is illegal; use digital currency only. FEMA is super involved. Loads of surveillance. Manifester’s phone rings – caller ID “The Wife” “I’m not going to pick that up.”]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-9-november-19,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 9 - November 19, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 01:01:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 10 - December 10, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>In-Game Date: Unknown<br>
Dimension: 1<br>Key Events:<br>
<br>Chase and Confrontation: The team intercepts <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a>, who has inadvertently become involved in a low-speed chase through the city in <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>’s Celica. The chase concludes in the West Bottoms, an area marked by desolation and ominous signs.
<br>Magnetic Crane Incident: Upon arrival, they find a magnetic crane holding the Celica aloft with <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a> inside, seemingly affected by the magnetic field. The crane appears damaged and is emitting smoke.
<br>Hostile Environment: The scene is fraught with danger, including a heavyset person in makeshift armor controlling a wind funnel of debris, and several hidden assailants in nearby buildings. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> take tactical positions to handle the threats from different angles.
<br>Dynamic Combat: As combat unfolds, <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> tries to communicate with the armored person but ends up getting pulled into the debris funnel. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> shoots an assailant who then becomes part of the chaotic debris cloud.
<br>Rescue Attempts: Voices calling for help are heard from a nearby building, adding a layer of urgency to the already tense situation. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> moves to investigate and provide aid.
<br>Supernatural and Technological Manipulations: The adversaries use a combination of physical attacks and supernatural or technological enhancements to challenge the heroes. <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>’s attempts at creating illusions to disable the armored person initially fail, increasing the peril for the team.
<br>Climactic Moments: The session culminates with <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> being pulled into the cyclone and <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> making a desperate attempt to dislodge the Celica from the magnetic crane. <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a>, stunned and disoriented, ends up pressed against the window next to <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a>’ head, highlighting the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the battle.
<br>Note: This session is filled with intense action and complex scenarios, testing the team’s abilities to adapt and respond to multifaceted threats in a hostile environment. The presence of civilians in distress adds emotional stakes to the encounter, while the mysterious abilities of the adversaries introduce new challenges that could have significant implications for future sessions.<br><br>[Jerry is smart, able to detect that we are from an alternate universe. Jerry cold and calculating; Blurry takes more risks, is enthusiastic, leader-like but not ranked.] Manifester is getting repeated texts asking why his car is on the news. TV turns on low-speed chase following Manifester’s Celica, Automatic Man is driving. [Automatic Man was run through computer simulations to develop his abilities and… he used Grand Theft Auto as his simulator] Manifester can feel a connection with the CD player despite being many miles away. Car is in River Market, headed towards West Bottoms somewhat erratically and badly. We stop at Gates for food before heading out to intercept Automatic Man. We meander towards him. An ARIES starts following us. As we get into West Bottoms, we pass barrels w graffiti of happy face with horns, ARIES vehicles stop following once we get there. We get to about 1104 Union Ave. Area is desolate. A Blackhawk helicopter is crashed on its side, smashed by blunt objects. A large magnetic crane is raised with Manifester’s celica attached to the magnet. Automatic Man is inside, looks exhausted, perhaps due to the magnetic field. Seems stunned. Nobody seems to be operating crane but smoke is coming out of it, not in great shape. Just past crane is a heavyset person wearing makeshift armor. In buildings can hear people scurrying about.<br>Templar detects movement on fifth floor of building to right, hears sound of automatic weapon cocking. In building on left, third floor, hears clanking of chains as a person has it on them or are chained up. Ahead hear wind swirling near the heavyset person, catching dust, small objects, rebar. An 8-foot horizontal cylinder of air begins to form. Mantis rolls down window and shouts towards heavyset person. Templar hears someone ducking down and cocking gun. He has supercar gun target the source of noise. (Order: Templar, Manifester, villains, Mantis) Templar turns car into defense mode and bales out, heading towards left parking garage, crouches behind a burnt out car. Manifester teleports up into building at fourth floor. Someone begins firing automatic weapon at Templar, missing but hitting the burnt out car. Wind baton is building up with larger and larger objects. Smoke coming out of crane is picking up. Mantis walks into the cylinder and catches a radiator from the debris, begins straightening it. Tries to talk to the heavyset person in armor, but they just flick him off. Templar shoots back at person shooting toward him; shot through the mouth, staggers and falls through the window to the ground. He (and the gun) begins churning in the debris field. Manifester runs to the end of the building. He has a good view of the crane and guy in armor; can tell he’s controlling the debris. Crane motor looks like it’s going to go in 3 turns. Manifester attempts to give stocky armor guy illusion of blindness; fails.<br>Stocky turns the debris into more of a funnel cloud. Mantis gets pulled up into the cloud. The metal of the pole Mantis uncoiled from radiator sticks to the magnetic dish. [Ion pack: have flight for 1d4 rounds, then takes 1d4 to recover] From building on left, Templar hears woman’s voice saying “help me! Help me!” and masculine voice saying “woman don’t get them involved. They’ll just get killed” Templar begins climbing to move into the building Manifester now attempts to give stocky guy illusion of sensory deprivation. Chunky armor guy sends cyclone towards Templar. Dead body smacks into Templar giving 4 pts damage and he’s pulled into cyclone, spinning through the air. Leaves Mantis hanging from the rod in the air. Mantis climbs up the radiator pole to underneath the car, grabs the frame and yanks in attempt to dislodge car, fails. The car only turns, still attached to magnet, driver side up. Automatic Man falls into the passenger side, his stunned face hits the window right next to Mantis’ head.]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-10-december-10,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 10 - December 10, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 01:16:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 11 - December 17, 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Intense Combat Resolutions: The battle with <a data-href="Windy" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/windy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Windy</a> and his wind manipulation continues. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> manages to hit him with a shot that sends him to the ground, dissipating the whirlwind. Despite a failed illusion attempt by <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>, <a data-href="Windy" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/windy.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Windy</a> relocates using his wind powers.
<br>Unexpected Interruptions and Public Sightings: Amid the chaos, <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> receives a call from his lawyer about Deadpool looking for him, and encounters tourists led by Mark Seargent, who dismisses <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> as animatronic to his tour group.
<br>Dramatic Rescues: <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> performs a heroic act by catching the falling Celica, proving to the onlookers that he is indeed real. <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> and <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> engage with more foes in a nearby building, encountering a woman chained up and a hostile entity known as <a data-href="Bulltoad" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/bulltoad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bulltoad</a>.
<br>Confrontations with New Enemies: The battle escalates with the appearance of new adversaries. <a data-href="Bulltoad" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/bulltoad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bulltoad</a> attacks <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a>, leading to a violent confrontation where <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> eventually incapacitates <a data-href="Bulltoad" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/bulltoad.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Bulltoad</a>. Meanwhile, an invisible woman and a concrete-like creature engage the heroes, adding layers of complexity to the fight.
<br>Dynamic Heroics and Tactics: As the fights unfold, the team employs a mix of physical combat, psychic powers, and tactical maneuvers. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> deal with the concrete creature, ultimately sending him crashing through the ceiling.

<br>Strategic Escape and Disguise: The session concludes with the team camouflaging their vehicles to pass through a controlled area undetected, leveraging the confusion and their abilities to escape potential further confrontations.
<br>Clues to Further Adventures: Inside the Celica, they find a costume catalogue addressed to a mansion on Ward Parkway, hinting at their next destination or link in their ongoing adventures.
<br>Note: This session is filled with action, strategy, and moments of humor and heroics that define the characters and their interactions with the world around them. The narrative continues to intertwine public perception, superhero antics, and personal stakes, driving forward the campaign’s overarching themes and setting up new avenues for exploration and conflict.<br><br>Templar swirling in the whirlwind, shoots at armor guy. Hits him, blasting him to the ground. Whirlwind starts to dissipate. Templar throws a rappel line onto the tallest building and swings towards Windy. Manifester attempts to create an illusion of the Celica falling onto Windy, but fails. Windy uses wind to fly into the second floor of the shorter building. Mantis’ cellphone ring. Talks to Paul Hood, his lawyer, asking about fight with ARIES. He says Deadpool ???? is looking for Mantis, riding his Vespa. Can hear loudspeaker of someone making announcement—the government thinks they can keep lying to us. First they said Earth is round, now they say superheroes are real. Mark Seargent Reality Tours on side of bus we see. Hear tourists saying “Mantis Shrimp is real!” Mark S says “No no, that’s animatronic” Mantis opens passenger door, and Automatic Man falls to the ground. Mantis drops down and pulls Automatic Man out of the area where car might fall. Templar moves across street, leaps from a burnt-out car onto an awning towards Wind Guy and the woman calling for help. Manifest teleports into the other building, second floor. Sees a woman wearing a harness with chain attached. She sees him then turns invisible, but harness and chain are still visible. “Looks like I’m interrupting something… I didn’t realize that club had moved here.” Chain goes back around a pillar and can’t see the end. They hear the engine of the crane give out. Car is falling. Mantis runs under and catches the car. People on the bus say “He’s not animatronic! Mantis Shrimp is real.” The tour bus quickly drives away with Mark grumbling.<br>Manifester sees Human-Toad-Bull combo. He says “You shouldn’t have come here. Now Bulltoad is gonna have to kick your ass!” Manifester blasts Bulltoad with psychic blast. Bulltoad comes bounding towards Manifester, jiggly and gores Manifester, pitching him out window onto awning. “Woman, see what you made me do? Carmelita you know I only keep you chained up because of certain masculine insecurities.” Templar shoots Bulltoad, and takes him down to 0; frog goo splatters all over Manifester. “You killed him! You killed him, you horrible monster!” Mantis puts Automatic Man into the Celica gently, covers him with a jacket, then jet-packs to where he saw Windy-Armor flee. Energy blast from invisible woman flies past Templar, who is now visible. Manifester psychic blasts at woman but misses. Bulltoad is breathing but incapacitated.<br>Templar runs towards woman, she blasts at him but misses again, again impacting the building. Mantis doesn’t see, but hear and feel wind picking up. Mantis has no idea where he is. Manifester attempts to make an illusion of Khaki Tacs storming the building, but fails. Templar tackles her. Zip ties her. Mantis hears a rumbling sound but not soon enough. Gets sucker-punched, 15 damage, flies skittering across the floor. Whoever punched him descends from the ceiling, looks like living concrete in human form. Mantis heads towards new threat, shrinking down. (+6 defense) Manifester misses with another psychic blast at concrete guy. Templar shoots him, but bullet appears to bounce off him. Concrete says “You’re gonna have to do better than that,” and smacks the ground and damages the ground. Mantis and Templar both fall through floor to the level below. Concrete reaches up and absorbs himself up into the ceiling. Mantis flies up through the hole in the floor back to the second floor. Manifester psychic blasts concrete guy for 1 stun dmg. Templar throws out rope and climbs back up to second floor.<br>Concrete swings at Mantis and misses. Mantis swings back, unshrinking, uppercutting and smashing concrete up and out through the ceiling and much later, there’s the sound of concrete falling. Situation resolved; they set Carmelita back up and reassure her the Bulltoad is ok. They loosen but do not remove her bounds. Now they need to get past the Khaki Tacts on the outskirts of the No-Go Zone. Manifester gets into the Celica and the CD player, scrambled by the magnet, now plays “Give It Up” by KC &amp; The Sunshine Band. Manifester then disguises vehicles as Khaki Tac vehicles, and they slip past without issue. In Celica they find a fancy costume catalogue, addressed to a house on Ward Parkway—basically a mansion.]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-11-december-17,-2023.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 11 - December 17, 2023.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 01:19:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 12 - January 20, 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Dimension: 1<br>Key Events:<br>
<br>Identity Shifts and Restraints: The team returns to the hotel to find that <a data-href="The Master" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-master.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Master</a> now looks like actor William Smith and expresses fear for his life, proposing a deal to provide information about <a data-href="The Gnome" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-gnome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gnome</a> in exchange for his release. <a data-href="Mantis Shrimp" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/mantis-shrimp.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Mantis Shrimp</a> also transforms back to his original appearance, Claude Crevette, losing most of his powers.
<br>Disguise and Deception: <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> successfully convinces <a data-href="The Master" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-master.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Master</a>, now called “Dave,” that his name is indeed Dave, and they head to the Majestic for a performance, disguised as Macho Man Randy Savage.
<br>Tension at the Majestic: At the Majestic, the team encounters Maxwell Manning in a dispute over performance order. The venue is filled with off-duty <a data-href="Khahki Tacs" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/khahki-tacs.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Khahki Tacs</a> and fans of the bands performing, creating a tense atmosphere.
<br>Rescue and Revelation: Dave performs a procedure to remove false memories from Vicki, causing her significant emotional trauma. Meanwhile, <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> deal with emerging threats, including a blob of darkness that breaks through a wall during the performance.
<br>Chaotic Concert: The concert turns chaotic with members of the band revealing supernatural abilities and attacking the crowd. <a data-href="Templar" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/templar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Templar</a> and <a data-href="Automatic Man" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/automatic-man.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Automatic Man</a> work to neutralize the threats while <a data-href="Manifester" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/pcs/manifester.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Manifester</a> uses illusions to control the situation.
<br>Dramatic Confrontations and Escapes: The session climaxes with battles against various adversaries, including Dr. Fervid and Hannah the Hammer, who use their powers aggressively against the team. The conflict ends with the band members escaping through a magical banner, leaving the team to manage the aftermath and ensure the safety of the bystanders.
<br>Master’s Fate and Aftermath: As the session closes, <a data-href="The Master" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-master.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Master</a> thanks his “foolish friends” for their attempt to rescue him, highlighting his manipulative nature. The team manages to subdue the remaining threats, but the banner through which the adversaries escaped still glows ominously, suggesting further complications.
<br>Note: This session was filled with a mix of combat, negotiation, and performance art, blending the bizarre with the supernatural in a public setting. The team had to balance their actions between public safety and tactical combat, all while dealing with personal transformations and complex enemy abilities. The ongoing narrative threads involving Dave and the implications of his knowledge about <a data-href="The Gnome" href="https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/npcs/bad-guys/the-gnome.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gnome</a> add depth to the campaign’s storyline.<br><br>Session 12: 1/20/24<br>Return to hotel room; Master still there and restrained but now looks like different now—looks like actor William Smith instead of weird bulbous headed person. Mantis feels weird and then changes into Claude Crevette, his original appearance and without most of his powers. Master is perturbed but hiding it bc he’s afraid of us. He says it’s highly likely he won’t survive the evening. He’s wondering once he’s removed the false memory, what does he do next. Manifester decides to call Master “Dave.” Creates illusion to make him believe his name is actually Dave, which succeeds. Dave admits there was no agreement, but he’s hoping we’ll release him. Leans on his theme of persecution. We agree to release him if he does his job, but also gives us a writeup of everything he knows about The Gnome. Manifester creates illusion to disguise them, but accidentally makes them look basically exactly like Macho Man Randy Savage ---we head to the Majestic--- We come upon Maxwell Manning arguing with someone “The First Laws are never going to open for a fucking Bon Jovi cover band!” When he sees Automatic Man he comes over “Ian! Tell these fuckwads will never open for this fucking hack act!” A bunch of hipster kids waiting for the doors to open defend the band: The Ardent Natural Philosophers of BJ. A guy comes out looking like Jermaine from Flight of the Concords and says “Maxwell, I respect what you do. We’ll open for you!” Inside, Majestic crawling with off duty Khaki Tacs; off duty, drinking, but armed. Act will be downstairs. We overhear Khaki Tacs having get together bc 2 colleagues were killed today fighting anomalies. Mantis asks Manifester if there’s anything he can do to get rid of the “brownies.” Manifester attempts to make illusion of call to send all available KTs to the airport; fails.<br>Templar sits down in the midst of the KTs and says “what’s up guys.” Chit chats with them. Overhears they will be getting an advantage soon. “George, they don’t need to know about that!” Master – uses mind reading to discover they have a supersoldier serum plus an internal commlink. Vicki walks in with a companion. We head downstairs. Stage to left, bar to right. More hipsters. More KTs. Fans of the First Laws (16 to 96 years old, lots of dusters, trenchcoats, cutoff shorts, almost all wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars, some in sunglasses). Also attractive woman with dark hair in red cocktail who visibly reacts at the sight of Manifester—it’s Leandra. She speaks into her watch. He gets text message: “Dear why are you here, and what have you done with your hair.” She’s flirting with a nerdy looking computer guy. He texts back “Incognito. Act naturally. I’ll explain it all later. PS do you have any cash on you.” She texts back “Just cards. Low profile. Good idea.” On stage there’s a banner that’s ornate, Celtic looking symbol plus the name of the band. Vicki and friend are at a table. Leandra is wearing glasses; they look polarized or high tech. Jermaine-looking guy comes out. Introduces self as Dr Fervid. “Master of the Hunt on guitar” antler hat guy. Woman in green clothing with hat partly covering eyes “Hannah the hammer on drums and dulcimer” three women in dresses “And the banshees backing me up” then finally “our final member gets in scraps and he’s got himself killed again on the I-??? bridge, but don’t worry he will join us again soon. For now, we have Sammy Von Newman.” Guy looks like a smaller version of Automatic Man. Then they break into a version of Bad Medicine<br>Maxwell is disgusted by this “You see why we will never open for this crap? But Ian, your younger brother is a pretty good bass player.” Midway through set, Vicki heads towards the back, towards bathroom. Manifester follows her with Dave, Mantis, and Manifester. Templar sits at bar eating steak, watching over them. Manifester and Dave talking: Dave admits it will take 2-3 minutes and will cause her some significant trauma. Manifester makes an illusion of a janitor mopping up vomit; it works but on the ceiling. Dave quickly undoes his prior work. Vicki drops to the floor sobbing. Manifester drops the illusion and walks out of the area. Automatic man moves to check on Vicki. She pulls away from him. He asks her “Vicki are you ok. Are you ok. Are you ok Vicki.” “No, I don’t know what’s happened to me. It’s like a terrible dream. Help me back to my friend Dianne.” Automatic Man takes her through the club to the bar. Templar hears grumbling, scraping, scratching sound behind wall opposite stage. Templar looks at Dave and says “Your friends?” “Those foolish loyal creatures! Are they here to rescue me” Wall crumbles and a blob of darkness emerges as the band continues to play. Templar turns to KTs, “That looks like your job, boys.” Initiative roll<br>Manifester urges people to leave. Some people do move that way. Mantis tells Dave “IF you’ve done your homework, you’re free to go.” He gives paper re: The Gnome and runs towards the MOLES. Band keeps playing over and over again “ooooh, we’re halfway there. Ooooh, we’re halfway there…” and everyone that’s a normal person is frozen in place. The three ladies start singing “Shot through the heart!” and KTs start to point guns at the hipsters. Templar looks for power source for amplifiers and shoots it. Music gets quieter, still playing but not amplified. Templar then points toward the band, “Stop playing or you’re next.” When music collapses, big guitarist with no sleeves and antlers on his head hops off stage and starts wielding guitar like an axe and blades pop out. Automatic Man attempts to blast him with energy blast, it hits the wall making a major explosion but injuring no one. Hannah the Hammer moves to take cover behind dulcimer stand. Dr Fervid shoots green energy out his eyes at Templar. Manifester attempts illusion to mute the singing; succeeds. KTs shake their heads and are stunned by their own behavior. The Banshees see it and know Manifester interfered. Automatic Man with Maxwell together continue to sing the next line “Take my hand and we’ll make it I swear!” Mantis starts a chain of holding hands. The hipsters and khaki tacs begin grabbing hands and bolting towards the stairs. Hannah the Hammer hits dulcimers and banner above band starts to glow. Dr Fervid fires a blast at Automatic Man, dealing 5 pts damage. The Banshees pull knives from their outfits. Mantis only sees Leandra turn invisible and hit a banshee with an energy blast (he later gets a text “You’re welcome, dear”). Other two miss when throwing knives at Manifester. Master of the Hunt swings at Automatic Man but misses. Sammy tries to punch Dr Fervid but misses.<br>Manifester mind blasts Master of the Hunt; 3 pts stun damage. He falls to one knee.<br>
Templar shoots green eyes (Dr Fervid) for 4 pts. His appearance changes, looks less human and more diabolical. Master’s voice “Thank you, thank you my friends. Not just you, MOLES, you foolish friends. Thank you for coming to get me.” Automatic Man blasts Master of the Hunt, misses. Manifester mind blasts Hannah. Mantis heads over towards Leandra, shoots Hannah doing 6 dmg. Hannah says “We should flee,” then runs and jumps into the banner, disappearing. Two banshees grab the third, then also flee through the banner. Dr Fervid begins singing “We’ll meeeeet again! Don’t know where… don’t know when…” He then blasts Automatic Man for 3 more pts damage. Templar shoots at him, missing and Dr Fervid jumps through the banner. Master of the Hunt stands, staggering. Automatic Man smashes him with a fist, punches him so hard antlers fly off his head and driving him into the floor. He expires. Vicki and her friend escape upstairs. The banner is still glowing…<br>]]></description><link>https://kcheroes.grognards.rocks/sessions/session-12-january-20,-2024.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Sessions/Session 12 - January 20, 2024.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Todd Keyser]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 01:30:16 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
